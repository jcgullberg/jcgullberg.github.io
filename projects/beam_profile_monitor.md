### Introduction
The beam profile monitor is a device that is mounted near the end of a proton accelerator that can be slid into the beams path to give data of itsâ€™ shape and position. It currently needs to be operated by hand and the accelerator room; hence it cannot be actuated when the accelerator is on. The aim of this project is to design and construct a device that can actuate the monitor from the control room while the accelerator is on.
 
### Design Approach
The design approach taken has been to be as minimally invasive as possible, the aim was to create an actuator that does not require any permanent modifications to the current framework, where it can be removed so the handle would function just as it does now.
The handle is a 22 mm thick cylinder that is 40 mm in diameter, which slides linearly in and out 52mm. It requires approximately 30 newtons to pull out, determined through several tests. The two options for actuation are a pneumatic air cylinder or an electric linear actuator. 
A weighted evaluation matrix was constructed to compare some of the options found on McMaster-Carr that all meet the requirements.
