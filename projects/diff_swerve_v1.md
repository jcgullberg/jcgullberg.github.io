## About
This project was originally started just as a fun side project for me to improve my design skills that was also partly inspired by my growing interest in robotics. I wanted to make 4 of them and mount them on a sofa or chair so I could drive around in any direction, but unfortunatly never got around to that due to cost constraints, however it did lead to me getting hired onto my schools VEXU robotics team directally as a technical lead to help them develop a Vex legal version.

## The Design
