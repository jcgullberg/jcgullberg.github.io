## About
This project began two thirds the way through the 2023 ~ 2024 Vex season, when I got recruited onto the team specifically for this project. But fresh off designing my first swerve module, I knew exactally all the changes and improvements I needed to make, which allowed me to go from joining the team to a finished and working prototype in lass than a week.

The modules we supposed to be completly printed on Markforged printers in Onyx CF Nylon, unfortunatly we ran out of time beforethe compitition so only a couple parts in each module was nylon and the rest were printed in PLA.

During our matches at the Vex World Chanmpionship in Dallas, My biggest fear was the reliability of the modules would be poor. Luckily the modules actually held up quite well, the only fault we had in all our matches was the teeth sheard off one of the bevel gears due to under extrusion in the print.

Although we didn't place that well overall, after the compitition we discussed all the changes that needed to be made and got to work making an increadibly compact and reliable swerve module that the team can use for the next few years.

## The Reason For Omni Wheels - Nick's Master Plan
Nick, who is a masters student on our team, and also a very well know individual in the Vex robotics community, came up with a master plane to use omni wheels on the swerve modules, which can be angled to act as a CVT.

The way it works is similar to X-drive, where in X-drive when the drivebase moves forward it goes at √2 times faster than the linear speed of the wheels, because the omni wheels are angles at 45° reletive to the direction of travel.

With our modules, we can now change the angle of attack of the wheels reletive to the direction of travel (theta), causing the speed of the robot to be sec(Θ) multiplied by the linear speed of the wheels. Letting us in theary, reach infinite speed.

This lets our robots simaltainously be capable of more torque or more speed than any other robot, with the added degree of freedom thanks to it being swerve drive, this is the most optimal drivetrain in Vex EVER, giving us an unparalled advantage.
