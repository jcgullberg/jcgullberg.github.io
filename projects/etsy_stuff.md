## Nintendo Switch Apple Watch Charging Stand
###### This made up about 80% of my sales, and the design was constantly iterated and improved over the years. I eventually also made different colors to match the real switch colors, like the animal crossing version.

## Pokeball AirTag Keychain
###### This was originally made to hide an Airtag on my backpack in case it gets stolen, but the insert peice was later modified to hold micro sd cards or pretty much anything else that fits.

## Adjustable Tablet Stand
###### This tablet stand has a curved rack and pinion setup with a worm gear connected to a knob on the bottom, that lets you continouasly adjust the angle. The design was supposed to be bubbly and friendly, and is a design I am very proud of, unfortuantly it did not sell too well.

## WDT Coffee Tool
###### This tool houses several acupunture needles in the handle to spread out and break up clumps of espresso grounds before tamping. It comes with a little holder that can attatch to you espressso machine with adhesives or magnets. The design went through dozens of iterations to get the shape, fit, and surface finish perfect.

## Banana Stand
###### A stand that lets you display a single banana, the design was inspired by traditional Japanese katana stands. I don't really know what I was thinking when I made this...

## Selling on Etsy
I got started on Etsy about halfway through Grade 11, when I got tired of dealing with people on Facebook Markeplace. Sales were super slow in the begining and I made just one sale in the first 3 months.
If you look at all these products I created, they all have a few things iin common, one of them being that they are all products that I wanted, but couldn't find or buy. All of these products I made for myself first, to make my life easier
