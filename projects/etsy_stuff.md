## Nintendo Switch Apple Watch Charging Stand
##### This made up about 80% of my sales, and the design was constantly iterated and improved over the years. I eventually also made different colors to match the real switch colors, like the animal crossing version.

## Banana Stand
##### A stand that lets you display a single banana, the design was inspired by traditional Japanese katana stands. I don't really know what I was thinking when I made this...

## Selling on Etsy
I got started on Etsy about halfway through Grade 11, when I got tired of dealing with people on Facebook Markeplace. Sales were super slow in the begining and I made just one sale in the first 3 months.
If you look at all these products I created, they all have a few things iin common, one of them being that they are all products that I wanted, but couldn't find or buy. All of these products I made for myself first, to make my life easier
