## Nintendo Switch Apple Watch Charging Stand
###### This made up about 80% of my sales, and the design was constantly iterated and improved over the years for easier assembly, better surface finish and more reliable printing. I eventually also made different colors to match the real switch colors, like the animal crossing version.

## Pokeball AirTag Keychain
###### This was originally made to hide an Airtag on my backpack in case it gets stolen, but the insert peice was later modified to hold micro sd cards or pretty much anything else that fits.

## Adjustable Tablet Stand
###### This tablet stand has a curved rack and pinion setup with a worm gear connected to a knob on the bottom, that lets you continouasly adjust the angle. The design was supposed to be bubbly and sleek, and is a design I am very proud of, unfortuantly it did not sell too well.

## Banana Stand

## Selling on Etsy
I got started on Etsy about halfway through Grade 11, when I got tired of dealing with people on Facebook Markeplace. Sales were super slow in the begining and I made just one sale in the first 3 months. But everything changed after I made a reddit post advertising the apple watch stand, where it got over 25k upvotes and got onto the front page. This caused me sell my entire stock in less than an hour, but wanting to capitalize off this oppertunity, I sold way more than I had and bought 2 new printers on amazon with next day shipping in hopes of printing them all in a 2 days. I ended up bearly getting any sleep the next few days trying to finish fulfilling all the orders. I managed to get all of them shipped with only a couple being delayed, and returned the extra printers I got immedietly after. All in all I made over $1500 bucks in one night, and to a high schooler that basically a million bucks.

Once I started getting bunch of 5 star reviews in, Etsy started recommending my products more and more, and I started getting a decent stream of income. I also experimented with advertising on Tik Tok and a bunch of Meta platforms but found mixed results. 

The summer I graduated high school I stopped making more projects, and just sold off old stock to focus on my studies at university, overall I made over $13k in sales, and learned so much about CAD, 3D printing, marketing, and much more.

If you look at all these products I created, they all have a few things in common, one of them being that they are all products that I wanted, but couldn't find or buy. All of these products I made for myself first, to make my life easier. I think this approch of solving a problem that I had personally allowed ne to make actually good solutions and products, and is what led to my seccess.
