I've had the opportunity to work on a diverse range of projects that showcase my skills from mechanical design 3D printing to electrical and software. From a fully 3D printed swerve drive mudule to an ion thruster, each project has been a valuable learning experience and a testament to my passion for solving complex problems and creating.

I invite you to explore my projects to see the detailed write-ups, CAD files, source code, and scematics.
